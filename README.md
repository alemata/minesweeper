Minesweeper exercice

# Important notes
- Guided for the OO paradigm I created two objects, with clear responsibilities:
    - `Tile` - Each cell, containing a mine, and other data.
    - `Game` - The board itself with the configuration, and a set of tiles.
I know there are more performant implementations, but those are not as descriptive as a Object Oriented way (and with a normalized db). I expect to be assessed on the quality of the code and readability rather than performance. If the intention of this exercise is to be performant, I have solution for that too. (I will develop it later just for fun!)

- I have been focused on a robust backend, well tested and then moved to the client side, that should explain why I did a poor UI/UX in that short period of time. Also I would have added client side tests.
